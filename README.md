Small project that explores the basics of the most popular ways to do parallel computing in JavaScript

Featured are:
1. Callbacks
2. Promises
3. Web workers
4. Parallel.js

Callbacks, promises and Parallel.js are all tested in the 'index.js' file. Web-workers code is in the folder 'workers', to test it just open the 'index.html' file and observe the console

There is also a file 'parallel-timings' that measures the speed of the same operation being performed using the 3 Parallel.js methods: spawn, map and reduce.
